Literacy Volunteers on the Green offers flexible class schedules and individualized instruction based on our students’ needs and goals. All of our students have different levels of English language skills as well as varied literacy in their own languages. We meet our students’ needs through small group instruction and one-on-one tutoring.

Our students and tutors come from towns throughout Northern Fairfield and Litchfield counties. Classes and tutoring sessions are provided on a flexible schedule in order to accommodate students’ work schedules. Students and tutors meet in a variety of public places, such as libraries, churches, schools, and restaurants in locations which are convenient for both students and tutors.

### History

Founded by Rita Guariglia and Anne Maitland in March of 2005, Literacy Volunteers on the Green started with 12 trained tutors and 30 students. By the beginning of 2013 we had assisted more than 500 students and trained more than 160 volunteer tutors. Our numbers continue to grow each year. Over the course of our eight year history, we have assisted more than 500 students and trained over 150 tutors.

Class sizes range from one tutor to five students and are designed to meet the individual needs and goals of the students. From the beginning, Literacy Volunteers on the Green has recognized that tutors are the backbone of the organization. Volunteer tutors are trained in the use of best and current practices in methods of teaching English as a second language prior to working with students.

LVG has created programs at New Milford’s John Pettibone School and Kent Center School to help non-English speaking parents better communicate with their children’s teachers. The programs have been so successful that we hope to replicate them in other interested elementary schools in the Northwest region. We offer a high school mentoring program to help students with the college application process. We also have special programs to help students prepare for the United States citizenship test and to communicate more fluently in the workplace. Through our website we offer numerous additional resources students can access at no cost.

Many of our students have gone on to start successful businesses as musical instructors, restaurant owners, landscape contractors and electricians. Others have become nurses in area hospitals, day care providers, pastry chefs, college students, and even LVG tutors.

In 2009, Literacy Volunteers on the Green was granted 501(c)(3) non-profit status with the Internal Revenue Service. LVG is an affiliate of ProLiteracy America and a United Way Partner Agency.
